Jasmine N Tom
-------------

As a fourth year undergraduate student at the [University of California, Santa Cruz](https://www.ucsc.edu/), I'm working towards earning my Bachelor's of Science in Mathematics with a minor in Statistics. Currently, my research interests lie in abstract algebra with a strong emphasis on Group Theory. With my profound passion for education and empowerment, I aspire to be an equity-minded educator in my field.
